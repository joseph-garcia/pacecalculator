# Run Improvement Journal
See your running improvements over time, no matter what distances you run.


# Description

If you like to run multiple distances, you can log your runs in this app. It will then adjust your run and estimate how fast you can run one mile.

Your runs in the journal will then be compared, so you can easily see if you're improving and by how much.

## Features
- See detailed journal entries around your pace, distance, time, and date.
- See your adjusted 1 mile time based on your journal entries
- Know how much faster or slower your average 1 mile time entry was compared to your previous entry
